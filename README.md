## Notes

- Some achievements have **tiers** (Default, Bronze, Silver, Gold).  
- **Public Sponsor**: requires an active sponsorship (can be as low as $1). Cancelling sponsorship does not remove the badge.  
- **Starstruck**: only one repository needs to reach the star milestone, but the badge reflects the **highest star count** achieved on any repo.  
- Manage badge visibility in [Profile Settings](https://github.com/settings).
